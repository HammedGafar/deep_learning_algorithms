# Deep Learning Algorithms

This repository is a collection of implementations for various deep learning algorithms and models. The goal is to provide clear and well-structured code for understanding different neural network architectures and concepts.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized to highlight different areas of deep learning:

- **pytorch_dense_network/**: Contains code for building and training fully-connected (dense) neural networks using the PyTorch framework.
- **recurrent_networks/**: Includes examples and implementations of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, useful for sequential data.
- **transfer_learning/**: Demonstrates the use of transfer learning techniques, including loading pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for new tasks.

## Models Implemented
The following classic convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures have been implemented as standalone scripts:

- **AlexNet.py**: A PyTorch implementation of the groundbreaking AlexNet architecture.
- **LeNet5.py**: A simple and educational implementation of the classic LeNet-5 model.
- **ResNet.py**: An implementation of the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture, which introduced skip connections.
- **VGG.py**: A PyTorch implementation of the VGG architecture, known for its component based architecture.
